Package: dynIRTtest
Title: Dynamic Estimation of Group-Level Opinion
Description: Fit dynamic group-level item response theory (IRT) and multilevel
    regression and poststratification (MRP) models from item response data. dynIRT
    models latent traits at the level of demographic and geographic groups,
    rather than individuals, in a Bayesian group-level IRT approach developed by
    Caughey and Warshaw (2015) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpu021>. The package also
    estimates subpopulations' average responses to single survey items with a
    dynamic MRP model proposed by Park, Gelman, and Bafumi (2004)
    <doi:10.11126/stanford/9780804753005.003.0011>.
